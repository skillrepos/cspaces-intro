# Understanding and using GitHub Codespaces - lab setup

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment that you can use to run the course labs.

These steps **must** be completed prior to starting the actual labs.

## Create your own repository for these labs

- Create your own copy of this repository by forking the [skillrepos/spaces](https://github.com/skillrepos/spaces) project as a template into your own GitHub area.
- You do this by clicking the `Fork` button in the upper right portion of the main project page and following the steps to create a copy in **your-github-userid/spaces** .
